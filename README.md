# Simple Inventory Card

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-41BDF5.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

To use, install the [Simple Inventory](https://github.com/blaineventurine/simple_inventory) integration. Both it and this repository need to be installed as custom repositories in HACS for now.

This card allows you to track various items in different inventories, and automatically add an item to a specific to-do list when it is below a certain threshold.
